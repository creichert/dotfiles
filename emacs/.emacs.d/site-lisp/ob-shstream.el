;;; Commentary:

;; the default ob-sh evaluation for shell scripts in org-mode is
;; blocking, so commands like e.g.
;;
;; #+BEGIN_SRC sh
;; ping -c 5 127.0.0.1
;; #+END_SRC
;;
;; will block when run, and results only become visible when the
;; process terminates. :session may be able to hand this, but it
;; doesn't currently work for me OOTB. ob-shstream is a simple
;; workaround.
;;
;; It returns a process buffer name immediately on eval, saves the
;; eval contents to a shell script in `org-babel-temporary-directory`
;; and executes it with `bash`. org-babel thus outputs the unfinished
;; process buffer name as the result, and the process buffer is shown
;; with output asynchronously appended. When the process terminates,
;; the output replaces the unfinished process name result as the final
;; org-babel #+RESULTS section.
;;
;; NOTE: header arguments (e.g. session) are not supported
;;
;; async update procedure modified from http://www.drieu.org/code/sources/tail.el
;; also see:
;; http://orgmode.org/w/worg.git/blob/HEAD:/org-contrib/babel/ob-template.el
;; http://orgmode.org/w/?p=org-mode.git;a=blob_plain;f=lisp/ob-eval.el

;;; Usage:

;; load this file and update org-babel settings:
;; (org-babel-do-load-languages
;;  'org-babel-load-languages
;;  '(...
;;    (shstream . t)
;;    ...))
;; then use like a normal sh block, but replace "sh" with "shstream"

;;; Requirements:

;; defaults to evaluation using `bash`

;;; Code:
(require 'ob)
(require 'ob-ref)
(require 'ob-comint)
(require 'ob-eval)
;; possibly require modes required for your language

;; This is the main function which is called to evaluate a code
;; block.
;;
;; This function will evaluate the body of the source code and
;; return the results as emacs-lisp depending on the value of the
;; :results header argument
;; - output means that the output to STDOUT will be captured and
;;   returned
;; - value means that the value of the last statement in the
;;   source code block will be returned
;;
;; The most common first step in this function is the expansion of the
;; PARAMS argument using `org-babel-process-params'.
;;
;; Please feel free to not implement options which aren't appropriate
;; for your language (e.g. not all languages support interactive
;; "session" evaluation).  Also you are free to define any new header
;; arguments which you feel may be useful -- all header arguments
;; specified by the user will be available in the PARAMS variable.
